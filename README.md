# BOOK-GENRE-PREDICTION
In this project, we take the synopsis or summary of a book as input and then instead of classifying the book into a single genre, we provide the proportions of genre suited to book.
Sometimes, a book is classified into a genre as that particular genre is present in the highest proportions. But a dedicated reader always likes to know the subgenres and subtropes which he or she can find in the book. So, with this project, we are going to predict the genre proportions of a book based of its synopsis or summary.The tools that exist classify the book into one major genre but our tool would predict the proportions of different genres that the book would belong to. The different chatbots that we use today, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc., would sometimes give you the genre with proportion and sometimes just the major genre it belongs to. It would depend on the model in use.  But in this tool, I will try my best that the model accurately predicts the genre and sub genre of ab book based of its synopsis with a user friendly interface and interaction.
